This submission contains the source code, README, and Makefile for our Project 2 for CS 118.

Instructions
1) Make will build both regular and congestion control server
2) Our client works with both types of servers
3) Run the regular server with command of form ./server [required args]
4) Run the congestion control server with command of form ./cc_server [required args]

Description of How We Divided the Work Load
Kyle - Initial 3-way ACK procedure
     - Initial congestion window code
     - Initial timeout/retransmission procedure
     - Report
     - Testing/debugging
     - Some of extra credit

Jair - Initial boilerplate code, packet.h and basic transmission
     - Finishing 3-way ACK procedure
     - FIN Procedure
     - Report
     - Testing/debugging

TODO:
Extra credit

Testing retransmissions:

Adding fixed delay to all packets:
tc qdisc add dev <network info> root netem delay <time>
- use ifconfig to find what to put in <network info>
  - eg. eth0
- <time> is the amount of delay that will be added
  - eg. 100ms

Adding distributed delay to all packets:
tc qdisc change dev <network info> root netem delay <time1> <time2> distribution normal
- do the same as above for network info
- <time1> should be greater than <time2>
  - eg. 100ms and 20ms

Packet Loss
tc qdisc change dev <network info> root netem loss <percent>
- do the same as above for network info
- <percent> is the percentage of packets that will be lost
  - eg. 50%
