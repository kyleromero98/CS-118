TODO:
Test retransmissions
Check with Cade and Amit about ACKing last FIN packet
Extra credit

Testing retransmissions:

Adding fixed delay to all packets:
tc qdisc add dev <network info> root netem delay <time>
- use ifconfig to find what to put in <network info>
  - eg. eth0
- <time> is the amount of delay that will be added
  - eg. 100ms

Adding distributed delay to all packets:
tc qdisc change dev <network info> root netem delay <time1> <time2> distribution normal
- do the same as above for network info
- <time1> should be greater than <time2>
  - eg. 100ms and 20ms

Packet Loss
tc qdisc change dev <network info> root netem loss <percent>
- do the same as above for network info
- <percent> is the percentage of packets that will be lost
  - eg. 50%
